# DevOps Enablement Strategy



## Overview

This delightful guide was written as a project for a Liatrio project to have an independent look at enlightening a company 'XYZ' to the path of DevOps.

## Navigation

The meat of the content is written from xMind application which does mind maps and roadmaps very well so collaboration may be easier on changing content.  The content was then converted for the most part into Mural dashboard for discussion and presentation with Liatrio personnel.  A pdf per review day is roughly made so progress may be seen on the Mural side.

## xMind
The files in this folder are built using [xMind](https://xmind.app/) - my personally favorite tool for roadmaps and mindmaps.

- XYZ Strategy to Kickoff and Scale - mind map of basic tenants to form the content and create the roadmap
- Kickoff and Scale Roadmap - Milestone / Phased delivery of DevOps enablement for XYZ company.

## Mural

The key assets are [in Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/devops9838/m/devops9838/1696537845649/a99433c0d0f81d29ffbb6450ffd7c284c836df8f?sender=u2d487bd78877e2acccd59212) in 'live' state but a pdf is stored at the root of this repo to reflect changes over time.

Run through the outline to see slides in order for presentation and view instructions for content details of slides.
